# InstaShorts

InstaShorts is a simple, Instagram-inspired app that allows users to view, like, and comment on video reels sourced from the Pexels API. This project focuses on implementing core concepts like state management and API integration.

## What I Learned

- **API Integration with Retrofit:** Learned how to integrate external APIs using Retrofit, focusing on fetching data from the Pexels API to populate the app with video content.
- **State Management with BLoC:** Gained hands-on experience with the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for managing app states in a scalable and maintainable way.
- **UI Development in Flutter:** Improved my Flutter skills by designing a user-friendly, smooth interface that mimics the experience of Instagram Reels.
- **Async Programming:** Enhanced my understanding of asynchronous programming by handling network requests efficiently and managing UI updates after fetching data.
